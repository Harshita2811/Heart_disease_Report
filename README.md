Heart Disease Prediction
Made by Harshita Anand

In this machine learning project, I have collected the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) and I will be using Machine Learning to predict whether any person is suffering from heart disease

Data Processing
After exploring the dataset, I observed that I need to convert some categorical variables into dummy variables and scale all the values before training the Machine Learning models. First, I'll use the get_dummies method to create dummy columns for categorical variables.
